# 👨🏼‍💻 Deploying Web Application on AWS With AWS Amplify, Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway 👨🏼‍💻

 *Hey there!*
 
 In this project, as you can guess from the title, we will use AWS, which stands for Amazon Web Services; an excellent cloud platform with endless services for so many various use cases from training machine learning models to hosting websites and applications. Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage, and databases. Serverless functions are a type of cloud computing service that allows you to run code without managing servers.

Project Workflow:

-  Deploy a static website to AWS Amplify.
> 
- Create a serverless function using AWS Lambda.
> 
- Build a REST API with API Gateway.
> 
- Store data in a NoSQL database using DynamoDB.
> 
- Manage permissions with IAM policies. Integrate your frontend code with the backend services.
