 # Deploy Web App on AWS With AWS Amplify, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM and API Gateway
   Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage, and databases. Serverless functions are a type of cloud computing service that allows you to run code without managing servers.

   Project includes 5 AWS services:

# Deploy a static website to AWS Amplify.

# Create a serverless function using AWS Lambda.

# Build a REST API with API Gateway.

# Store data in a NoSQL database using DynamoDB.

# Manage permissions with IAM policies. Integrate your frontend code with the backend services.
